# microbit-shooter

A small game project for the BBC micro:bit that is being used as a driver to develop distributed game libraries.

__Very__ much a work in progress.

### How to compile and install:

See [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZT9YcPsR-To2kQpRb6Q6RIYCqXsT9LDIWzZImJKM-Wg/edit) for instructions.

*Better formatted instructions in markdown coming soon.*

===

If your environment is already setup, just the following to download required libraries:

```bash
yotta target bbc-microbit-classic-gcc
yotta install lancaster-university/microbit

```

And finally `yotta build` to generate your .hex file.
